Meditation is a method of training attention and awareness, as well as achieving a cognitively clear and emotionally peaceful and stable state, via the application of a technique such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a specific object, thought, or activity.

Meditation is used in a variety of religious systems. Meditation (dhyana) is first recorded in the ancient Vedic books known as the Vedas, and it is an important part of Hinduism and Buddhism's contemplative repertoires. Asian meditative techniques have expanded to Western countries since the 19th century, where they have found use in non-spiritual contexts like business and health.

Meditation has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, sadness, and pain as well as improve peace, perception, self-concept, and overall well-being.

Meditation has many advantages. In the busy lifestyle we don’t give attention that much to meditation. Considering the usefulness of meditation here we are aiming to build a meditation website which can help people to meditate. This website will contain many features. One of main features will be direct meditation in which a person can meditate directly from a website i.e. in background pleasant music will be played and timer will be set so that person can meditate for that much amount of time. Another feature contains information about nearby meditation centers at which a person can go and meditate. It will help the people to find a nearby meditation center. Here this website will aim to make it easy for people to do meditation online or offline.
